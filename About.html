In 2008, McGregor started his mixed martial arts (MMA) career and, in 2012, he won both the Cage Warriors Featherweight and Lightweight Championships, holding both titles concurrently before vacating them to sign with the UFC. In 2015, at UFC 194, McGregor defeated José Aldo for the UFC Featherweight Championship via knockout thirteen seconds into the first round. This was the fastest victory in UFC title fight history. Upon defeating Eddie Alvarez for the UFC Lightweight Championship at UFC 205, McGregor became the first fighter in the UFC's history to hold titles in two weight divisions simultaneously.

    <h3 class="orange"> Early Life </h3>
    <p class="padding">
McGregor was born in Dublin, Ireland to Tony and Margaret McGregor. He was raised in the South Dublin suburb of Crumlin and attended a Gaelscoil and Gaelcholáiste at both primary and at secondary level in Coláiste de hÍde in Tallaght, where he also developed his passion for sport playing association football.

    <h3 class="orange"> Fighting Style </h3>
    <p class="padding">
McGregor is known mostly as a striker and prefers to fight standing up as opposed to on the ground. McGregor is left handed and primarily fights out of the southpaw stance, but often switches to a conventional stance as well. He will frequently try to be the aggressor in his bouts. McGregor's boxing is typically considered his best skill, with the majority of his victories coming by way of knockout or technical-knockout via punches. Many pundits cite McGregor's pull-back left-handed counter as his most dangerous strike.

    <p class="padding">
McGregor will almost always engage in trash talk and "psychological warfare" against his opponents which have led to comparisons to Muhammad Ali, whom McGregor cites as one of his early inspirations. After Ali died in June 2016, McGregor opined that "nobody will ever come close to [Ali's] greatness".

McGregor frequently trains in Reykjavik, Iceland, at the Mjölnir gym, alongside fellow UFC fighter Gunnar Nelson. McGregor stated that he does not adhere to any pre-fight rituals or superstitions because he believes them to be "a form of fear".
